# Discrete Fresnel Transform (DFnT) and Inverse DFnT (IDFnT) in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of the Discrete Fresnel Transform (DFnT) and its inverse (IDFnT). These transforms are useful in various signal processing and optical applications.

## Discrete Fresnel Transform (DFnT)

The Discrete Fresnel Transform (DFnT) is used to model the propagation of waves and involves quadratic phase terms. It can be expressed mathematically as follows:

### Even \( N \)

For an even \( N \), the DFnT is given by:

\[
DFnT(x)_m = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \exp\left(\frac{j\pi}{N} (m - n)^2 - \frac{j\pi}{4}\right)
\]

### Odd \( N \)

For an odd \( N \), the DFnT is given by:

\[
DFnT(x)_m = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \exp\left(\frac{j\pi}{N} (m + 0.5 - n)^2 - \frac{j\pi}{4}\right)
\]

In these equations:
- \( x_n \) is the input signal.
- \( N \) is the length of the input signal.
- \( m \) and \( n \) are indices.
- \( j \) is the imaginary unit.

## Inverse Discrete Fresnel Transform (IDFnT)

The Inverse Discrete Fresnel Transform (IDFnT) is used to revert the DFnT back to the original signal. It can be expressed mathematically as follows:

### Even \( N \)

For an even \( N \), the IDFnT is given by:

\[
IDFnT(X)_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} X_m \exp\left(-\frac{j\pi}{N} (m - n)^2 + \frac{j\pi}{4}\right)
\]

### Odd \( N \)

For an odd \( N \), the IDFnT is given by:

\[
IDFnT(X)_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} X_m \exp\left(-\frac{j\pi}{N} (m + 0.5 - n)^2 + \frac{j\pi}{4}\right)
\]

In these equations:
- \( X_m \) is the transformed signal in the Fresnel domain.
- \( N \) is the length of the transformed signal.
- \( m \) and \( n \) are indices.
- \( j \) is the imaginary unit.


The DFnT and IDFnT are similar in structure to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its inverse, but they incorporate quadratic phase factors. These phase factors make the DFnT particularly suitable for applications involving wave propagation and diffraction patterns.
